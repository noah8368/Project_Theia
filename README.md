This is the server-side implementation of Project Theia: a Node.js server that
interfaces with our MongoDB instance and our React front-end to facilitate the
storage and modification or user information. In particular, this server
provides a login system and a place to store favorite websites for every user.

To get started, open up your command line, navigate to the server directory,
and type "node app.js".
